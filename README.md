# Ghoul Spawn
(**Note:** Until the mod is ready, not all data is included intentionally to prevent running while it may be buggy.)

## About
Ghoul Spawn is a mod that takes ghouls from various Ghoul's Forest versions and Ghoul's vs. Humans: Multiverse. Ever wanted a more challenging experience to your various DooM WADS where Ghouls can spawn and attack you to spice things up? This is the mod for you! It takes the ghouls out of the forest and into the Hellscape you venture through to spice things up a bit.

Included is a **codex** that will detail everything this mod adds. Through it, you can also access the **Talents** system which you can use to make dealing with ghouls easier.

More info coming soon!
